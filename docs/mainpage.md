# Deep Learning C++ #

## Overview ##
Deep Learning C++ (DLCPP) is a small software package that implements a neural<br/>
network (nn) with methods for stochastic gradient descent. It is intended to be<br/>  
used for educational purposes, not performance, and the code reflects this. This<br/>  
code implements the nn described in the first two chapters of Michael Nielsen's<br/>  
book, *Neural Networks and Deep Learning*.
