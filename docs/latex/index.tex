\subsection*{Overview}

Deep Learning C++ (D\+L\+C\+PP) is a small software package that implements a neural~\newline
 network (nn) with methods for stochastic gradient descent. It is intended to be~\newline
 used for educational purposes, not performance, and the code reflects this. This~\newline
 code implements the nn described in the first two chapters of Michael Nielsen\textquotesingle{}s~\newline
 book, {\itshape Neural Networks and Deep Learning}.
