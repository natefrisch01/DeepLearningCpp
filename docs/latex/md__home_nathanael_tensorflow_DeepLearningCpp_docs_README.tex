\section*{Overview}

Deep Learning C++ (D\+L\+C\+PP) is a small software package that implements a neural network (nn) with methods for stochastic gradient descent. It is intended to be used for educational purposes, not performance, and the code reflects this. This code implements the nn described in the first two chapters of Michael Nielsen\textquotesingle{}s book, {\itshape Neural Networks and Deep Learning}.

\section*{Dependencies}

Eigen3 Doxygen

\section*{Installation}

The mnist/ folder is meant to hold the git repository that can be found here\+: \href{https://github.com/wichtounet/mnist}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/wichtounet/mnist}

If you didn\textquotesingle{}t use the --recurse-\/submodules tag when cloning, you can use the command\+: {\ttfamily git submodule update -\/-\/init -\/-\/recursive}

To build\+: {\ttfamily mkdir build} {\ttfamily cd build} {\ttfamily cmake ..}

To run executable (from build directory)\+: {\ttfamily ./tests}

\section*{Contributions}

Please feel free to fork the code and fix any bugs, add updates, or implement the more complicated nn\textquotesingle{}s described later in the book.
