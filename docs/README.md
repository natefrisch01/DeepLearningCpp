# Overview #
Deep Learning C++ (DLCPP) is a small software package that implements a neural
network (nn) with methods for stochastic gradient descent. It is intended to be
used for educational purposes, not performance, and the code reflects this. This
code implements the nn described in the first two chapters of Michael Nielsen's
book, *Neural Networks and Deep Learning*.

# Contributions #
Please feel free to fork the code and fix any bugs, add updates, or implement
the more complicated nn's described later in the book.
